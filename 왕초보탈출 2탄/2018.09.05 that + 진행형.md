# that + 진행형

I am looking for the apartment that has three rooms

명사 + that + be + 동사원형~ing

- '~하는 중인 명사'를 표현할 수 있다
- 일반동사를 써야하는지 be동사를 써야 하는지에 대한 형태적 고민 없이 말할 수 있는 장점이 있다

the person that is reading a book
the airplan that is flying to Japan is coming now
the people that are studying English

the student that is going to busan
the students that are going to busan

~ 하다 => ~한
is busy / that is busy
is big / that is big
is fun / that is fun

the people that are busy
the people that are late
the person that is wearing jeans
the students that are studying hard

부정
'be not 일반동사~ing'
the people that are not working here
the student that is not studying

the people that are taking the subway are late
the people that are taking the subway will be late
the people that are working hard can make money
