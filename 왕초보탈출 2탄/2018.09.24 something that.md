# something that ~

is cold 차갑다
that is cold 차가운
something that is cold
I'm cold, so I need something that is hot

someone 누군가
someone that has been watching 계속 봐왔던 누군가
someone that has been busy

something that you've been drinking
something that you've been eating
something that you've been reading
something that has been coming to Korea

There is someone that I've been wating for 내가 기다려온 누군가가 있다
There is someone that has been wating for me 나를 기다려온 누군가가 있다
There is someone that has been giving me a ride 나를 계속 태워주는 사람이 있습니다
(give a ride 태워주다)

# 확장강의

I am wating
I was wating
I have been wating

I am working
I was working
I have been working

the website that I am working on 내가 작업하고 있는 중인 웹사이트
the website that I was working on 내가 작업하고 있었던 웹사이트
the website that I have been working on is this 내가 계속 작업해온 웹사이트는 이거야

This is something that I have been planning
something that I have been planning is different
something that you have been expecting is different
something that you have been thinking is wrong
The seat that you have been sitting on
