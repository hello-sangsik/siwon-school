**미래 진행형 : '~하는 중일 거다'**

will be studying.
will be drunking.

He will be sleeping
He will be working tomorrow.
I will be waiting for you.

**과거 진행형 '~하는 중이었다'**

I was waiting.
I was reading a book.
I was going to starbucks.

We were drinking coffee.
We were having a breakfast.

I was asking for coke.
I was looking for my watch.
He was talking about me.
They were dreaming.
Where were you?
Where was he?
